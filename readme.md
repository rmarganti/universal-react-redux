# Universal React Redux

Just what the world needs, another react+redux boilerplate.

## Goals
* **Universal rendering** (both server and client)
* **PASSWORD OAUTH2 GRANT** - This boilerplate was made to access authorization servers that have OAuth2's Password Grant enabled. This generally means that you or your organization   are the owners of both the client and the authroization server
* **Brainless API calls** - auth tokens are securely maintained on the server side and injected into  any calls to the API server. No need to worry about it on the client-side.

## Additional Features/Inclusions:
* React
* Redux
* React Router
* styled-components
